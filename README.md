## Problem Statement

Students often face difficulty making informed career decisions due to fragmented access to guidance, limited awareness of personal strengths, and rapidly evolving job markets. Traditional counseling systems lack personalization, scalability, and real-time adaptability — leading to mismatches in career paths, underutilized potential, and future regret.


----


## Proposed Solution
The Carrier Companion will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to address the lack of personalized and scalable career guidance that autonomously supports students in making informed, future-ready career decisions with much ease.
